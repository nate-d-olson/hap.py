# Migration Progress Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Test Migration**
   - ✅ Fixed and updated existing test `test_happy_pg.py`
   - ✅ Created new pytest test `test_integration.py` (migrated from run_integration_test.sh)
   - ✅ Created new pytest test `test_gvcf_homref.py` (migrated from run_gvcf_homref_test.sh)
   - ✅ Created new pytest test `test_fp_accuracy.py` (migrated from run_fp_accuracy_test.sh)
   - ✅ Created new pytest test `test_hapenum.py` (migrated from run_hapenum_test.sh)
   - ✅ Created new pytest test `test_pathtraversal.py` (migrated from run_pathtraversal_test.sh)
   - ✅ Created new pytest test `test_decomp.py` (migrated from run_decomp_test.sh)
   - ✅ Created new pytest test `test_other_vcf.py` (migrated from run_other_vcf_tests.sh)
   - ✅ Updated PYTHON3_MIGRATION_PROGRESS.md to reflect completed migrations
   - ✅ Updated tests/README.md with instructions for running tests

2. **Type Hints**
   - ✅ Added type hints to `src/python/Haplo/cython_compat.py`
   - ✅ Added type hints to key functions in `src/python/Tools/bcftools.py`

## Key Features of Migrated Tests

1. **test_happy_pg.py**
   - Tests PG evaluation with different engine options (standard, vcfeval, pass-only, unhappy)
   - Handles vcfeval availability dynamically
   - Compares output summaries with expected results

2. **test_integration.py**
   - Tests hap.py with different input configurations (empty inputs, standard, unhappy mode, pass-only)
   - Tests multimerge functionality
   - Compares VCF outputs and summaries with expected results

3. **test_gvcf_homref.py**
   - Tests multimerge with homref blocks
   - Tests multimerge with homref blocks and variants
   - Notes known issues in the codebase (commented sections)

4. **test_fp_accuracy.py**
   - Tests processing of FP regions
   - Compares VCF and summary outputs with expected results

5. **test_hapenum.py**
   - Tests hapenum's ability to enumerate haplotypes
   - Generates and verifies dot graph output
   - Handles SVG generation for visualization

6. **test_pathtraversal.py**
   - Tests hap.py's handling of path traversals
   - Verifies summary outputs match expected results

## Next Steps

1. **Type Hints**
   - Continue adding type hints to core Python modules
   - Add more type hints to `src/python/Tools/bcftools.py`
   - Begin adding type hints to `src/python/Haplo/quantify.py`

2. **Test Verification**
   - Run all migrated tests on a fully-built version of the project
   - Address any issues with test assumptions or file paths

3. **Cross-Platform Testing**
   - Verify build and tests on Ubuntu and macOS

## Notes

- Integration tests require a built version of the project
- The test utils module provides important helper functions for test consistency
- All migrated tests include proper pytest markers for integration and slow tests
- Linting was applied to ensure code quality
