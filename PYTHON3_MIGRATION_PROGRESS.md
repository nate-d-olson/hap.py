   - ✅ Added minimal setup.py for backward compatibility
   - ✅ Added deprecation warning to install.py

2. **Dependency Management**
   - ✅ Consolidated all dependencies in pyproject.toml
   - ✅ Removed references to pybedtools and other unused dependencies
   - ✅ Added proper version constraints

3. **Test Framework**
   - ✅ Created pytest.ini configuration
   - ✅ Added conftest.py with test fixtures
   - ✅ Set up utility functions for tests in tests/utils.py
   - ✅ Migrated all 21 shell tests to pytest format (100% complete)

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - ✅ Set up GitHub Actions workflow for multiple OSes and Python versions
   - ✅ Configured linting with black and ruff
   - ✅ Configured mypy type checking
   - ✅ Set up CI for running both unit and integration tests

5. **Documentation**
   - ✅ Updated MIGRATION_GUIDE.md with developer information
   - ✅ Added pre-commit configuration for code quality

## Next Steps

1. **Test Migration (Priority)**
   - ✅ Completed migration of all shell tests to pytest format
   - 🔍 Add more test fixtures for common patterns
   - 🔍 Update the migrate_test.py script to better extract test logic

2. **Type Annotation**
   - 🔍 Add type hints to core Python modules
   - ✅ Added type hints to Haplo/cython_compat.py
   - ✅ Added type hints to Tools/bcftools.py
   - ✅ Added Path handling for better file path management
   - 🔍 Continue with Haplo/quantify.py and other modules

3. **Dependency Management**
   - ✅ Created happy.requirements.py3.txt with Python 3 compatible dependencies
   - 🔍 Update imports to follow modern Python conventions (e.g. import pandas as pd)

4. **Documentation**
   - 🔍 Set up Sphinx for API documentation
   - 🔍 Create user guide with updated installation instructions
   - 🔍 Document CLI commands and entry points

5. **Build System Refinement**
   - 🔍 Test wheel building on Windows
   - 🔍 Configure for PyPI publication
   - 🔍 Add Windows-specific build instructions

5. **Version 1.0.0 Preparation**
   - 🔍 Complete test coverage of critical components
   - 🔍 Remove deprecated functionality and installation methods
   - 🔍 Create release checklist and publish to PyPI

## Next Immediate Actions

1. Continue adding type hints to these core modules:
   - ✅ src/python/Haplo/cython_compat.py (completed)
   - ✅ src/python/Tools/bcftools.py (partially completed - key functions done)
   - src/python/Haplo/quantify.py (partially completed)

2. Run black on each module to fix formatting issues:

   ```bash
   black src/python/Haplo/cython_compat.py
   black src/python/Tools/bcftools.py
   ```

3. Test the newly migrated pytest tests to ensure they work as expected:
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_happy_pg.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_integration.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_gvcf_homref.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_fp_accuracy.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_leftshift.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_hapenum.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_pathtraversal.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_quantify_stratification.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_decomp.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_other_vcf.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_giab.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_performance.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_fastasize.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_blocksplit.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_chrprefix.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_faulty_variants.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_hapcmp.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_multimerge.py -v`
   - Run with `pytest tests/integration/test_quantify.py -v`

4. Test the build process on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows to ensure cross-platform compatibility
