# Progress Report for Version 0.1.0

## Completed

- Bumped package version to **0.1.0** in `src/happy/version.py`.
- Updated CMake and packaging scripts to support macOS SDK paths.
- Ensured legacy test harness (`src/sh/run_tests.sh`) invokes `install.py --no-tests`, builds C++ and Python components, and runs all existing `run_*.sh` scripts.
- Integrated GitHub Actions CI workflow to build on Ubuntu and run the full test suite.
- Added semicolon escaping in `src/c++/main/CMakeLists.txt` to fix CMake parsing errors.

## Next Steps

1. Wait for GitHub Actions CI to complete on `main` (Ubuntu) and confirm all tests pass.
2. Update documentation:
   - Add macOS-specific build instructions (setting `SDKROOT` and include paths) to `doc/build_system.md`.
   - Document the new version and installation instructions in `RELEASES.md`.
3. Prepare for publishing:
   - Review changelog entries and finalize release notes.
   - Tag the repository at `v0.1.0` once CI passes.

*This is an experimental development snapshot; no PyPI publication until tests are green.*
