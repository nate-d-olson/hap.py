# Python 3 Migration and Modernization Progress

This repository has been migrated to Python 3 with a focus on core functionality (vcfeval comparison engine and stratified metrics).

## Completed Migration Tasks

* Updated all core Python files to Python 3 syntax
* Improved string handling and encoding/decoding for Python 3
* Fixed subprocess handling and output capturing
* Added improved type hints for better code maintainability
* Updated CythonSupport.cmake for better NumPy and Cython detection
* Created simplified requirements files for Python 3 dependencies
* Fixed the install.py script to work with Python 3
* Added helper scripts for testing Python 3 compatibility

## Using the Python 3 Version

To build and install:

```bash
python3 install.py /path/to/install/dir
```

To test:

```bash
./test_py3_core.sh
```

## Remaining Work

* Complete testing of all core functionality
* Further optimize performance with Python 3
* Add improved error handling throughout the codebase
* Expand the test suite for Python 3 specific issues
