# Truncated Files Report

## Summary

During the Python 3 migration of the hap.py codebase, several files were identified as being truncated during the conversion process. This report documents the files that were affected and the steps taken to restore them.

## Affected Files

The following files were identified as having significantly fewer lines after migration compared to their Python 2 backup files:

1. `src/python/Haplo/happyroc.py` - 273 lines (88% of original)
2. `src/python/Somatic/Pisces.py` - 136 lines (79% of original)
3. `src/python/Somatic/Strelka.py` - 439 lines (73% of original)
4. `src/python/Somatic/Varscan2.py` - 257 lines (61% of original)
5. `src/python/Tools/bcftools.py` - 279 lines (73% of original)
6. `src/python/Tools/roc.py` - 176 lines (63% of original)

## Recovery Process

A script (`fix_truncated_files.py`) was developed to restore these files using one of two approaches:

1. Using Python 3-specific versions of the files if they exist and contain at least 90% of the content from the backup
2. Adapting the Python 2 backup files with Python 3 compatibility fixes

### Python 3 Compatibility Fixes Applied

The following compatibility fixes were applied when using backup files:

- Updated shebang lines to use `python3`
- Converted exception handling from `except X, e:` to `except X as e:`
- Added encoding parameters to file open operations
- Preserved other Python 3 changes that may have been previously applied

## Results

All six truncated files were successfully restored to their full content with appropriate Python 3 compatibility updates. The line counts of the restored files now match their original Python 2 backups.

### Final Line Counts

| File | Original (Truncated) | Backup | Restored |
|------|--------------|--------|----------|
| src/python/Haplo/happyroc.py | 273 | 312 | 312 |
| src/python/Somatic/Pisces.py | 136 | 172 | 172 |
| src/python/Somatic/Strelka.py | 439 | 601 | 601 |
| src/python/Somatic/Varscan2.py | 257 | 420 | 420 |
| src/python/Tools/bcftools.py | 279 | 381 | 381 |
| src/python/Tools/roc.py | 176 | 279 | 279 |

## Notes on Recovery

1. The truncation appears to have occurred during the automated Python 2 to 3 conversion process.
2. The sections that were lost were predominantly at the end of the files.
3. All truncated files had backup versions available which were used for recovery.
4. The detailed Python 3 compatibility fix records are in the commit history.

## Next Steps

1. Continue with the remaining Python 3 migration tasks, particularly focusing on the Haplo module which was identified as the highest priority area.
2. Update the test framework to detect similar issues in the future.
3. Verify that the recovered files work correctly by running the comprehensive test suite.
