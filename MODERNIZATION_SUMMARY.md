# hap.py Modernization Summary

## Completed Work

- All high-priority C++ components have been successfully migrated to Python:
  - **blocksplit**: Migrated to Python using pysam
  - **quantify**: Migrated to Python using pandas and pysam
  - **vcfcheck**: Migrated to Python using pysam
  - **preprocess**: Migrated to Python using pysam
- Initial Python 3 migration of a medium-priority C++ component:
  - **hapcmp**: Migrated to Python using pysam, with initial unit tests.

- Python 3 compatibility has been established:
  - Updated string handling for unicode compatibility
  - Removed Python 2-specific idioms
  - Added type hints for improved code clarity
  - Set up modern project structure with pyproject.toml

- Code quality improvements:
  - Added pre-commit hooks for automatic formatting and linting
  - Configured pytest for modern testing framework
  - Improved logging and error handling

## Current Implementation Status

- Overall migration progress: 62.5% complete (5/8 components) <!-- Updated -->
- All HIGH priority components have been migrated (4/4)
- MEDIUM priority component migration initiated: `hapcmp` (1/3 migrated) <!-- Updated -->
- No LOW priority components have been migrated yet (0/1)

## Implementation Details

### Preprocess Component

The preprocess component (now fully migrated to Python) includes:

- Variant decomposition (splitting multi-allelic variants)
- Left-alignment of variants using reference genome
- Normalization (trimming common prefixes/suffixes)
- Special handling for haploid regions (e.g., chrX)
- Region filtering and PASS-only filtering
- BCF output support

### hapcmp Component

The `hapcmp` component (now with an initial Python migration) includes:

- Reading VCF files and a reference FASTA.
- Parsing regions from a BED file.
- Generating haplotypes for variants within specified regions (simplified initial approach).
- Comparing sets of haplotypes between two VCF files for a given region.
- Outputting results in BED format and optional JSON diffs/error files.
- Command-line interface for tool usage.

### Test Coverage

- 6/14 unit tests have been migrated to pytest (includes initial tests for `python_hapcmp.py`) <!-- Updated -->
- 19/22 integration tests have been migrated

## Next Steps

1. **Migration of Medium Priority Components**:
   - xcmp: Comparison component
   - scmp: Comparison component
   - Finalize and enhance `python_hapcmp.py` and its tests.

2. **Test Migration**:
   - Complete migration of unit tests to pytest
   - Complete migration of integration tests
   - Add more test coverage for Python implementations

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update user documentation to reflect Python 3 compatibility
   - Document the Python implementations of components
   - Update installation instructions

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Benchmark Python implementations against C++ originals
   - Optimize critical paths for large VCF files
   - Consider parallel processing improvements

5. **Packaging**:
   - Create proper Python package distribution
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
   - Publish to PyPI

## Dependencies

- Need to add biopython for sequence manipulation (ensure `sequence_utils.py` leverages it effectively if already present)
- Currently using pysam (utilization likely increased with `python_hapcmp.py`)
- Currently using pandas (utilization percentage may need recalculation)
- Currently using numpy (utilization percentage may need recalculation)

## Conclusion

The modernization effort is progressing well, with all high-priority components and one medium-priority component (`hapcmp`) now migrated to Python. The codebase is more maintainable and follows modern Python practices. The remaining work focuses on the other medium and low-priority components, as well as testing and documentation improvements.
