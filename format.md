Reformat: Clean-up codebase to ensure if utilizes and follows modern python3 best-practices for coding and packaging. Should pass pre-commit hooks as defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

- Carefully review the codebase and check for coding and project structuring issues using the appropriate tools.
- After reviewing the identified issues, develop a plan to address the issues breaking on the changes into small well defined tasks.
- Iteratively work through the definted tasks addressing as many as possible. After completing a task review the task list reason through the plan to address the issues and revise as appropriate.
- If you continue to run into errors on a specific task, document the error and move on to complete remaining tasks that are not dependent on the failing task.
- While you work on the project, create dated files such as `.codex/plan_2025-05-19.md` containing your planned milestones, and update these documents as you progress through the task. For significant pieces of completed work, update the README.md with a dated changelog of each functionality introduced and reference the relevant documentation.
