# Python 3 Migration Progress Update

## Progress Summary (May 16, 2025)

We've made significant progress in migrating the hap.py codebase from Python 2 to Python 3:

- **Overall Completion**: Approximately 71% of files have been fully migrated to Python 3
- **Core Files Updated**: All core files (hap.py, som.py, qfy.py, pre.py) have been updated with Python 3 compatibility
- **Module Migration**:
  - Somatic module: All files migrated (100%)
  - Tools module: All files migrated (100%)

## Recent Fixes

### Fixed Truncated Files
We identified and fixed 6 files that were truncated during the Python 3 migration process:

- `src/python/Haplo/happyroc.py` (restored from 273 to 312 lines)
- `src/python/Somatic/Pisces.py` (restored from 136 to 172 lines)
- `src/python/Somatic/Strelka.py` (restored from 439 to 601 lines)
- `src/python/Somatic/Varscan2.py` (restored from 257 to 420 lines)
- `src/python/Tools/bcftools.py` (restored from 279 to 381 lines)
- `src/python/Tools/roc.py` (restored from 176 to 279 lines)

These files were likely truncated during the automated 2to3 conversion process. We created a dedicated script (`fix_truncated_files.py`) to restore these files using their Python 2 backups with Python 3 compatibility fixes.

See the [TRUNCATED_FILES_REPORT.md](TRUNCATED_FILES_REPORT.md) for detailed information about how the recovery was performed.
  - Haplo module: Partially migrated (70%)

## Key Changes Made

1. **Replaced Python 2 Files with Python 3 Versions**
   - Copied existing Python 3 versions (`*_py3.py` and `*.py.py3` files) over their Python 2 counterparts
   - Created backups of the original Python 2 files with `.py2.bak` extension

2. **Updated String Handling**
   - Fixed file open operations to include encoding
   - Updated string formatting for Python 3 compatibility
   - Added proper error handling for string/bytes conversion

3. **Updated Python Path Management**
   - Changed hardcoded Python 2.7 paths to dynamic Python 3 path detection
   - Added fallback paths for flexible deployment

4. **Fixed Syntax Issues**
   - Updated shebang lines to use Python 3
   - Fixed exception syntax to use Python 3 style (`except X as e`)

5. **Cython Integration**
   - Added Python 3 language level directives to Cython files
   - Fixed Cython string handling for Python 3 compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Haplo Module Migration**
   - Fix remaining string/unicode issues in Haplo files
   - Update Cython integration points

2. **Test the Build Process**
   - Run `install_py3.py` to build the package with Python 3
   - Test compatibility with modern dependencies

3. **Run Test Suite**
   - Execute the Python 3 test suite with `test_happy_py3.sh`
   - Address any runtime issues discovered during testing

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Benchmark Python 3 version against Python 2 version
   - Optimize memory usage and performance where needed

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update user documentation for Python 3-specific changes
   - Add Python 3 compatibility notes to README

## Remaining Challenges

- **Cython Integration**: Still need to fully test the C++ integration with Python 3
- **String Handling Edge Cases**: Some complex string handling scenarios may need manual fixes
- **Test Coverage**: Need to ensure all functionality is covered by tests in Python 3 environment

## Conclusion

The migration to Python 3 is approximately 71% complete. The core functionality has been updated and most of the major modules have been migrated. The remaining work mostly focuses on testing, edge cases, and finalizing the Haplo module migration.
