# Development Plan for hap.py Python 3 Migration

## Current Status

The Python 3 migration of hap.py has made significant progress with core components updated, but several key areas still need work. This document outlines the development plan for completing the migration.

## Phase 1: Critical Type Fixes (Current Phase)

### Objectives

- Fix critical type annotation issues that affect functionality
- Ensure C++/Python boundary string handling works correctly
- Address mock implementation initialization issues

### Tasks

1. ✅ Fix string_handling.py type annotations
2. ✅ Update mock_internal.py with proper type hints
3. ⬜ Fix Tools.vcfextract.py type errors
4. ⬜ Address string formatting issues in Tools.vcfcallerinfo.py
5. ⬜ Fix initialization issues in remaining mock implementations

### Acceptance Criteria

- Code builds and passes basic functionality tests
- Core CLI tools run without type-related errors
- String conversion at Python/C++ boundary works correctly

## Phase 2: Linting and Style (Next Phase)

### Objectives

- Clean up the codebase to follow Python best practices
- Fix import ordering and structure
- Address ambiguous variable names

### Tasks

1. ⬜ Fix E402 (Module level import not at top of file) errors
2. ⬜ Fix F401 (Unused imports) errors
3. ⬜ Fix E741 (Ambiguous variable names) errors
4. ⬜ Fix F821 (Undefined names) errors
5. ⬜ Run black, ruff, and isort on all Python files

### Acceptance Criteria

- All files pass linting checks with black, ruff, and isort
- Code structure follows Python best practices
- Import statements are organized correctly

## Phase 3: Testing Framework Migration

### Objectives

- Migrate from nose to pytest for testing
- Expand test coverage
- Fix failing tests

### Tasks

1. ⬜ Convert existing nose tests to pytest format
2. ⬜ Update test discovery and execution
3. ⬜ Add fixtures for common test setup
4. ⬜ Expand test coverage for core modules
5. ⬜ Fix any failing tests

### Acceptance Criteria

- All tests run successfully with pytest
- Test coverage meets minimum threshold (80%)
- CI/CD pipeline passes with pytest

## Phase 4: Package Structure and Distribution

### Objectives

- Create proper Python package structure
- Update import statements throughout the codebase
- Implement proper installation and distribution

### Tasks

1. ⬜ Reorganize code into proper package structure
2. ⬜ Update import statements to use the new structure
3. ⬜ Finalize pyproject.toml configuration
4. ⬜ Create proper packaging and distribution

### Acceptance Criteria

- Package installs cleanly with pip
- Import statements work correctly
- Installation instructions are clear and accurate

## Phase 5: Documentation and Release

### Objectives

- Update all documentation to reflect Python 3 changes
- Document any breaking changes or migration guidance
- Prepare for release

### Tasks

1. ⬜ Update README and main documentation
2. ⬜ Document any breaking changes
3. ⬜ Create migration guide for users
4. ⬜ Update API documentation
5. ⬜ Create release notes

### Acceptance Criteria

- Documentation is clear and accurate
- Users can understand how to migrate to the new version
- Release notes detail all changes

## Timeline and Resources

### Estimated Timeline

- Phase 1: 2 weeks
- Phase 2: 2 weeks
- Phase 3: 3 weeks
- Phase 4: 2 weeks
- Phase 5: 1 week

Total: Approximately 10 weeks

### Resource Requirements

- 1-2 developers familiar with Python and C++
- CI/CD infrastructure for testing
- Test environments (Linux, macOS)

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **C++ Integration Issues**: Issues at the Python/C++ boundary may be difficult to debug
2. **Test Coverage**: Existing tests may not catch all issues
3. **Dependencies**: External dependencies may have their own Python 3 compatibility issues

### Mitigation Strategies

1. Create more comprehensive tests focusing on Python/C++ boundary
2. Implement broader test coverage before finalizing changes
3. Verify and pin compatible versions of all dependencies
