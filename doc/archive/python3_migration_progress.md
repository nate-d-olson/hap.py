# Python 3 Migration Progress Report

## Overview

This document archives the progress and current status of the Python 3 migration for the hap.py codebase. It records completed tasks, ongoing work, and remaining items to track the migration journey.

## Completed Tasks (as of May 21, 2025)

### Core Infrastructure

- âœ… Updated pyproject.toml with proper dependencies and configurations
- âœ… Created setup.py shim for backward compatibility
- âœ… Updated Python version requirement to 3.7+
- âœ… Integrated code quality tools (black, ruff, isort, mypy)
- âœ… Configured linting settings in pyproject.toml

### CLI Tools Update

- âœ… Updated main CLI scripts (hap.py, qfy.py, pre.py) to Python 3
- âœ… Removed auxiliary scripts (ovc.py, cnx.py) not needed for core functionality
- âœ… Added proper error handling and status codes
- âœ… Fixed sys.exit() usage to propagate status codes properly
- âœ… Added type hints to main functions

### Codebase Cleanup

- âœ… Removed unused C++ modules (scmp directory and XCmpQuantify files)
- âœ… Removed unnecessary Tools module (bamstats.py)
- âœ… Removed somatic and xcmp engine code from hap.py
- âœ… Updated tests to work without removed components
- âœ… Simplified engine selection to only support vcfeval

### String Handling

- âœ… Created string_handling module with proper type annotations
- âœ… Fixed string/bytes conversion at Python/C++ boundary
- âœ… Added proper Unicode handling for file I/O
- âœ… Updated file handling for Python 3 text vs binary modes

### Type Annotations

- âœ… Fixed critical type errors in string_handling.py
- âœ… Added type annotations to mock_internal.py
- âœ… Fixed None initialization in data structures

## In Progress

### Type Annotation Improvements

- ðŸ”„ Addressing mypy type errors in remaining core modules
- ðŸ”„ Fixing string format type compatibility issues
- ðŸ”„ Adding proper type annotations to Tools modules

### Code Linting and Style

- ðŸ”„ Fixing import ordering issues
- ðŸ”„ Resolving circular import dependencies
- ðŸ”„ Addressing ambiguous variable names

## Remaining Work

### Type Annotations and Linting

- â¬œ Finish type annotations for all modules
- â¬œ Fix remaining mypy errors
- â¬œ Address all ruff/flake8 errors
- â¬œ Enable stricter type checking in mypy

### Testing Framework

- â¬œ Migrate from nose to pytest
- â¬œ Expand test coverage
- â¬œ Create additional integration tests
- â¬œ Fix failing tests

### Documentation

- â¬œ Update user documentation with Python 3 changes
- â¬œ Improve code documentation with Google-style docstrings
- â¬œ Document known issues and workarounds
- â¬œ Finalize installation and usage instructions

### Package Structure

- â¬œ Implement proper package structure with __init__.py files
- â¬œ Create proper package namespace
- â¬œ Update import statements throughout the codebase

## Migration Strategy for Remaining Work

1. __Prioritization__: Focus on fixing type issues that prevent the code from running correctly
2. __Incremental Approach__: Address issues module by module, starting with core components
3. __Testing__: Ensure each change is verified with tests before proceeding to the next
4. __Documentation__: Update documentation in parallel with code changes

## Key Lessons Learned

1. String handling between Python and C++ needs careful attention
2. Type annotations help catch many issues early and improve code quality
3. Proper dependency management is critical for Python 3 compatibility
4. Incremental updates with testing are more successful than wholesale changes
