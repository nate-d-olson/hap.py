# hap.py Modernization Progress Report

## Recent Updates (May 2025)

### Build System Modernization

We've implemented significant improvements to the hap.py build system:

1. **Modern CMake Architecture**
   - Implemented target-based CMake approach replacing global variables
   - Created modular CMake structure with dedicated component modules
   - Added CMakePresets.json for standardized build configurations
   - Improved dependency management with FetchContent

2. **Dedicated CMake Modules**
   - **CppSettings.cmake**: C++ compiler flags and standard settings
   - **CythonSupport.cmake**: Python/C++ integration
   - **HappyProperties.cmake**: Version and project settings
   - **MacOSPaths.cmake**: macOS specific path handling
   - **AppleCodeSign.cmake**: Code signing support for macOS

3. **C++ Build Improvements**
   - Updated library and executable configuration
   - Standardized compiler flags and warnings
   - Improved dependency declarations and linking
   - Added platform-specific optimizations

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Created detailed build system documentation
   - Updated modernization instructions
   - Enhanced development plan with detailed steps
   - Added IDE configuration for VSCode

## Next Steps

Our immediate focus areas:

1. **Complete Build System Migration**
   - Replace install.py functionality with pure CMake
   - Fix dependency detection issues (HTSlib, zlib)
   - Finalize installation targets

2. **Begin Python 3 Migration**
   - Run 2to3 tool on Python components
   - Fix syntax, string handling, and exception updates
   - Update dictionary and iterator methods
   - Test core components with Python 3

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Complete CTest integration for C++ components
   - Begin converting bash tests to pytest
   - Set up automated test execution

## Current Status

| Component         | Status | Description                                   |
|-------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Main CMakeLists   | ‚úÖ     | Modernized with target-based approach         |
| C++ Library Build | ‚úÖ     | Updated with modern CMake practices           |
| Executable Build  | ‚úÖ     | Standardized configuration                    |
| Test Framework    | üîÑ     | CTest integration, needs pytest conversion    |
| Python Package    | üîÑ     | Created pyproject.toml, needs more updates    |
| Installation      | ‚ùå     | Still using legacy system                     |
| Python 3 Port     | ‚ùå     | Not yet started                               |
| Documentation     | üîÑ     | Created build docs, needs API documentation   |

## How to Use the New Build System

To build hap.py with the modernized build system:

```bash
# Configure with a preset
cmake --preset=debug

# Build with parallel jobs
cmake --build --preset=debug -j8
```
