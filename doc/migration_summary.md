# hap.py Python 3 Migration Summary

## Migration Overview

The Python 3 migration of hap.py involves updating the codebase from Python 2 to Python 3, which requires several key changes:

1. Updating string handling (str vs bytes)
2. Modernizing package structure and dependencies
3. Adding type annotations
4. Improving code quality through linting and style updates
5. Enhancing testing and documentation

## Migration Progress

| Category | Progress | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Core Infrastructure | 90% | ðŸŸ¢ |
| CLI Tools | 100% | âœ… |
| Codebase Cleanup | 100% | âœ… |
| String Handling | 90% | ðŸŸ¡ |
| Type Annotations | 50% | ðŸŸ¡ |
| Testing Framework | 20% | ðŸ”´ |
| Documentation | 60% | ðŸŸ¡ |
| Package Structure | 40% | ðŸŸ¡ |

## Recent Updates (May 21, 2025)

1. Fixed type annotations in string_handling.py with proper typing
2. Updated mock_internal.py to properly initialize fields
3. Updated pyproject.toml with correct dependency versions
4. Added ruff configuration to control linting
5. Enhanced dependency documentation in dependency_management.md
6. Created development plan for remaining tasks

## Current Focus

The migration is currently focused on fixing type annotation issues in the core modules, particularly:

1. Tools.vcfextract.py
2. Tools.vcfcallerinfo.py
3. Haplo.quantify.py

## Next Steps

1. Complete type annotation fixes for remaining modules
2. Address linting issues (import order, unused imports)
3. Begin migrating tests from nose to pytest
4. Fix string format issues at Python/C++ boundary

## Breaking Changes

The migration introduced several breaking changes:

1. Removed auxiliary scripts (ovc.py, cnx.py)
2. Removed unused modules (bamstats.py, somatic features)
3. String handling now follows Python 3 conventions
4. Minimum Python version is now 3.7

## Documentation Updates

Documentation has been updated to reflect these changes:

1. Created python3_migration.md with guidance for users
2. Updated dependency_management.md with new dependency structure
3. Created cli_updates.md detailing changes to command-line tools
4. Added development_plan.md outlining next steps

## Known Issues

1. Some mock implementations may not fully match C++ behavior
2. Type annotation coverage is incomplete
3. Test coverage needs improvement
