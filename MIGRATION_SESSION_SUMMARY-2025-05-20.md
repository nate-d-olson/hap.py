# Migration Session Summary - May 20, 2025

## Completed Tasks

1. **Test Migration**
   - ✅ Created new pytest test `test_giab.py` (migrated from run_giab_test.sh)
   - ✅ Created new pytest test `test_performance.py` (migrated from run_performance_test.sh)
   - ✅ Created new pytest test `test_fastasize.py` (migrated from run_fastasize_test.py)
   - ✅ Verified existing test migrations for `test_blocksplit.py` and `test_chrprefix.py`
   - ✅ Updated PYTHON3_MIGRATION_PROGRESS.md to reflect completed migrations
   - ✅ Updated migration roadmap in multi-phase-modernization.prompt.md

## Key Features of Migrated Tests

1. **test_giab.py**
   - Tests small and large GiaB/RTG comparisons
   - Tests on both chromosome 1 and chromosome 21
   - Compares summary outputs with expected results
   - Includes appropriate assertions for result validation

2. **test_performance.py**
   - Tests consistency between simplecmp and hapcmp
   - Tests both standard VCF and GVCF functionality
   - Uses regex to parse and analyze BED file contents
   - Validates there are no "suspicious matches" in the output

3. **test_fastasize.py**
   - Tests the fastasize module's calculateLength function
   - Properly sets up Python path for imports
   - Verifies the correct length calculation for chromosome regions

## Current Progress Summary

- All 21 shell tests have been migrated to pytest format (100% complete)
- Tests have appropriate pytest markers for integration and cpp requirements
- All migrated tests follow consistent patterns using the test utilities

## Next Steps

1. **Test Verification**
   - Run all migrated tests on a fully-built version of the project
   - Address any issues with test assumptions or file paths

2. **Type Hints**
   - Continue adding type hints to core Python modules
   - Add more type hints to `src/python/Tools/bcftools.py`
   - Begin adding type hints to `src/python/Haplo/quantify.py`

3. **Cross-Platform Testing**
   - Verify build and tests on Ubuntu and macOS

## Notes

- Integration tests with @pytest.mark.cpp require the C++ components to be built
- The test utils module provides important helper functions for test consistency
- Migrated tests include proper pytest markers for integration, cpp, and slow tests
- All code follows the Black formatter style guidelines
