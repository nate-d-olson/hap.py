# Python 3 Migration Status Report

## Changes Completed

1. **Fixed Python Code Syntax Issues**
   - Fixed print statements across multiple files using our `automate_py3_updates.py` script
   - Corrected exception handling syntax from `except X, e` to `except X as e`
   - Updated dictionary methods from `iteritems()` to `items()`
   - Fixed line continuation syntax errors in `som.py`
   - Updated string handling in prints with file arguments
   - Converted unicode() calls to str()

2. **Build System Updates**
   - Copied Python 3 compatible `CMakeLists.txt.py3` to `CMakeLists.txt`
   - Updated Cython support with `src/cmake/CythonSupport.py3.cmake`
   - Configured Python 3 version detection in build scripts

3. **Cython Module Integration**
   - Created proper mock implementations for Cython modules
   - Updated `__init__.py` files with fallback mechanisms
   - Fixed string handling in Cython modules
   - Added improved error reporting for C++ integration failures
   - Successfully tested mock implementations

## Current Issues

1. **Remaining Python 2 Syntax**
   - Several files still contain Python 2 syntax
   - Approximately 60% of files have been migrated
   - Bare except blocks need to be updated to except Exception

2. **String Handling Issues**
   - Many instances of string vs bytes confusion
   - File handling needs encoding parameters
   - Binary data in VCF processing needs updates

3. **Build Integration**
   - C++ build errors with Python 3 integration
   - Dependency resolution for Python 3 packages

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Automated Code Updates**
   - Run the updated `automate_py3_updates.py` on all remaining files
   - Verify syntax errors are fixed
   - Update all bare except blocks to except Exception

2. **Test Build Integration**
   - Run the full build with Python 3
   - Address any C++ integration issues
   - Test with mock implementations if needed

3. **Test Core Functionality**
   - Create comprehensive integration tests
   - Compare outputs between Python 2 and 3 versions
   - Address performance and memory issues

4. **Documentation and Release**
   - Update documentation to reflect Python 3 compatibility
   - Create migration guide for users
   - Prepare release notes
