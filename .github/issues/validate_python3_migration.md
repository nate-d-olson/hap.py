## Issue Description
Need to thoroughly validate the Python 2 to Python 3 migration and fix any remaining issues.

### Tasks
- [ ] Run all test suites with Python 3
- [ ] Document and categorize any failing tests
- [ ] Fix remaining syntax and compatibility issues
- [ ] Ensure all Python dependencies are Python 3 compatible
- [ ] Verify command-line tools work correctly
- [ ] Test edge cases (especially around string encoding/decoding)
- [ ] Update any remaining Python 2-specific code patterns

### Technical Notes
- Migration was done using 2to3 tool
- Focus on input/output handling and string encoding
- Pay special attention to C extension interfaces
- Verify unicode handling in VCF processing

### Dependencies
None - this should be completed first

### Expected Outcome
- All tests passing under Python 3
- No Python 2 specific code remaining
- Documented list of any breaking changes
